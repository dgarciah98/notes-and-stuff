# notes-and-stuff
Here I will share some notes made in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) where I try to document and develop some of my personal projects at first, what I may upload here in the future is uncertain.

I make these notes along the [obsidian-git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) plugin to upload and synchronize them within my devices, alternatively I also use Syncthing.
## [arcade-cabs](arcade-cabs/README.md)
Notes related to arcade cabinet DIY projects, mostly rhythm game ones, with documentation of the processes and work I've done along with images.

Wiring diagrams that can be found have been made with the [WireViz](https://github.com/wireviz/WireViz), source files can be found as YAML files.
