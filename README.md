# [notes-and-stuff](dgarciah98.github.io/notes-and-stuff)
Here I will share some notes made in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) where I try to document and develop some of my personal projects at first, what I may upload here in the future is uncertain.

I make these notes along the [obsidian-git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) plugin to upload and synchronize them within my devices, alternatively I also use Syncthing.
